The sales dashboard was created by first collecting and cleaning data on order dates, sales, regions, and categories. The data was then grouped and aggregated to calculate total sales over time, by region, and by category. Visualizations such as line and bar charts were used to show trends and comparisons. Labels and totals were added for clarity, and all elements were organized into a clean, readable layout. Finally, the dashboard was exported as a PDF for sharing.
